# Production Problem 4: Color Palettes for HCI

## The Problem

Using either Adobe Color CC (https://color.adobe.com/), Paletton (http://paletton.com/), or another
Web-based palette generator of your choosing, you will create a number of different color palettes,
based on the requirements in the Deliverables section below.

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) screenshots of your web-based palette for the four palettes below;
2) an explanation, after each palette request below, why you chose the colors you did

* A monochromatic palette for a website that creates high-end, custom-made gaming laptops.

Filename: monochromatic.png 
Explanation of your color choices: Gaming computers are supposed to be fast, like a sports car. There is some type of societal association with fast cars being red so I give you a red theme. I didn't like all the colors being red, so I accented with a strong beige at the center of the wheel for a strong, grounded, natural feeling. 

* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.

Explanation of your color choices: I wanted to go with a pallete that evoked nature and freshness. Somewhat muted green tones serve this purpose well. Too much brighter and it starts to feel like easter. Too much more towards the blue side and I feel the ocean.

* A complementary palette for a banking website.

Filename: complementary.png
Explanation of your color choices: A finanical institution wants to have an image of trust and steadfastness. I picked a pallete that relaxes with a touch of blue, but portrays foundational strength in its dark grey and brown shades. This pallette doesn't look like it's messing around. I don't want my bank messing around.

* A triadic palette for a website that offers games for children.

Filename: triadic.png
Explanation of your color choices: I chose mostly bright, high-chroma colors that would catch a kid's attention. 3 strong colors: black, orange, greeen, and blue, make for a bright, playful feel. And intead of having a pure white to go with this set, there is a quiet lavender-ish tone that brings a hint of calm to the palette.
