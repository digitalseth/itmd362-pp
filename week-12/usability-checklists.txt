# Production Problem 7: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items. Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you've found:

1. https://web.wsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2015/08/25-point-usability-checklist-final.pdf
2. http://www.businessknowhow.com/marketing/webchecklist.htm

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1. There is a clear visual hierarchy of heads, and subheads, options,
and labels on each page
2. Paragraphs are short
3. Font size is legible
4. Page has a sufficient amount of whitespace (padding inside elements must not feel claustrophobic)
5. Color scheme is consistent site-wide
6. All major parts of the site are acesible from the home page
7. Site uses mobile screens effectively (not wasting valuable space on padding or huge logos)
8. Visitors can tell in 2 seconds or less what the site is about
9. Pages load quickly (images are compressed)
10. Site looks same/similar on all popular web browsers
